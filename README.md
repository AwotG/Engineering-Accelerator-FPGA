# Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA

Applying Engineering methodology to connect a VGA camera module to an FPGA (Snickerdoodle)

The goal of the Hardware Accelerator was to take students that already had a technical background (such as Physics or Computer Science) and teach them the work flows used in a professional engineering environment. The class was meant to take recent graduates or people looking to change fields and to condense one year worth of entry level engineering experience into three months. This involved understanding how deadlines are met and scheduled, how to work in a team, meticulous and clear documentation, accountability and testing. 

### Project Goals:
1. To bring-up the krtkl team's documentation, from the perspective of a complete beginner to FPGA's ([Completed](https://github.com/AwotG/Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA/blob/master/Documentation%20Bring%20Up.xlsx))

2. To successfully connect and stream video from a VGA camera module + Snickerdoodle and to display it to a monitor
    - Devise a deliverables schedule with mentor ([Completed](https://github.com/AwotG/Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA/blob/master/Snickerdoodle%20Deliverables.xlsx))
    - Create a Product Architecture ([Completed](https://github.com/AwotG/Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA/blob/master/Product%20Architecture.xlsx))
    - Create a Hardware Diagram ([Completed](https://github.com/AwotG/Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA/blob/master/Snickerdoodle%20Hardware%20Diagram%20V1.1.pdf))
    - Port VHDL code from similar project ([Completed](https://github.com/AwotG/Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA/tree/master/VHDL%20Code))
    - Generate a bitstream to upload to Snickerdoodle **(Completed)**
    - Create a Test Plan, to ensure that system works as expected (streams video from module) ([Completed](https://github.com/AwotG/Engineering-Accelerator-FPGA/blob/master/System%20Block%20Bring%20Up%20Test%20.xlsx))

### Current Status
1. Running into issue of FPGA pin mapping of snickerdoodle board not matching documentation.
